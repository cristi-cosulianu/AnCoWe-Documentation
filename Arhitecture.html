            AnCoWe is a web application that involves deploying 
            an anime-based (Anime API) RPG-style game and comic book 
            heroes (Marvel API) to reconstitute the classic Mario 
            gameplay scenario. Our user is able to choose more 
            features for Mario depending on the chosen character. 
            In addition, the user will be able to create a login 
            account with which he can save his or her preferences 
            for options (game keys, volume of sounds) and will be 
            able to participate in the Hall of Fame, after completing 
            the game his score will be entered in a list sorted with 
            the highest scores.

        <h2>Github Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          We used the following architecture for working on github.
        </p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          AnCoWe implemented the following MVC architecture:
        </p>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">
            <img src="Arhitecture/Presentation-MVC.png" width="880" height="655">
            <figcaption>
              Made with <a href="https://www.draw.io/">Draw.io tool</a>.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Our server it's made using the open source Node.js runtime 
          environment. We made this choice because of scalability and the
          relatively easy learning curve involved. 
          Because of our architectural design choice, our app is running on a 
          single thread and will allow hundreds of concurrent connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data that is used by our app it's stored using MySQL. The 
          connection between the database and our server is provided by mysql 
          node module (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql">link on npm</a>).
          Basically after a user connects to our game the client makes
          requests for some data (login, signup, options, scores, sessions), 
          our server will make a query to the database and then receive a response. 
        </p>
        <h4>App flow</h4>
          <figure typeof="sa:Image">
              <img src="Arhitecture/Presentation-AppFlow.png" width="880" height="655">
              <figcaption>

          <p>
            In mare parte orice actiune a utilizatorului, selectare de meniu, click pe login
            signup, taste apasate in cadrul jocului creaza requesturi specifice catre serviciu
            care interactioneaza cu baza de date pentru a putea construi in raspuns ce va fi
            procesat de catre client si va afisa rezultatul actiunilor utilizatorului.
            Dar cred ca diagrama este destul de sugestiva in a prezenta flow-ul aplicatiei.

        <h4>Modelling the database</h4>
        <p>
          <figure typeof="sa:Image">
              <img src="Arhitecture/Presentation-Database.png" width="880" height="655">
              <figcaption>
                  Made with <a href="https://www.draw.io/">Draw.io tool</a>.
                </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Our database consists of 4 tables (Users, Sessions, Scores, Options). 
            "Users" is the table containing the primary information that identifies 
            the user and links to the rest of the information about the user in the 
            rest of the tables. The "Sessions" table is used to uniquely identify 
            the user's game session and to store the current game information. The 
            "Scores" table is used to keep track of the results of the players, and
             the "Options" tab preserves player preferences related to game keys and 
             volume of sounds.
          </p>
        <h4>REST API</h4>
        <p>
          Our REST API has the following paths <code>/login</code>, <code>/signup</code>, 
          <code>/scores</code>, <code>/options</code> using AJAX tehnologies and using  "sockets.io" 
          for data transfer. We implemented <b>GET</b> methods for file transfer (<code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>,
          <code>.js</code>) and for data required in login, options, scores but even to transfer computation for game. 
          <b>POST</b> methods where used for options and signup .
        </p>

      <section typeof="sa:UseCases" id="useCases">
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
          This is how our use cases are looking.
        </p>

        <p>The homepage is the "Menu" page. It can be accessed only after the user is logged 
          in with an existing account or after creating a new account on the "Signup" page.
           From the "Menu" page, the user can access the Start game, Options, Hall of Fame,
           and Credits menus.
        </p>
        <p>Options is the menu from which you can change the user preferences related to game keys and volume of sounds.
        </p>
        <p>Hall of Fame is the menu where the top scores can be viewed.</p>
        <p>Credits is the menu where you can view a little story about the beginning of the project and how it went.
        </p>
        <p>The most exciting menu is the Start game that helps the user navigate further into Choose Characters
           where two lists with the Marvel or Anime characters can be selected. After selecting a character,
            you can see a description of the character and then navigate as many games as possible, where the
           player's capabilities will be tested to the maximum.
